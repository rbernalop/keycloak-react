# React and Keycloak integration

This project is a simple example of how to integrate React with Keycloak.
Keycloak is an open source identity and access management solution,
which allows you to secure your applications and services with little effort.
It makes it easy to implement a login/register flow, also with OAuth2 and OpenID Connect.
